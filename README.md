# Please read 
Please start the [Backend server](https://github.com/vsharma2266/finra-backend) before running the UI.

# FinraUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.5.

## Development server

Install all dependencies by `npm install` from project home.
Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Scenarios:
UI will only allow 7 or 10 digit phone numbers to be submitted.
But to show exception handling in the backend, I am allowing 13 digit number as well. The backend will reply with a custom error message which can be use for error handling in the UI.
